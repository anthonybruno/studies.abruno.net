## Converge to Inspire

When 4,000 developers, entrepreneurs, and creators decided to get together to explore how Meta is shaping the future of the digital landscape, we knew we had to build an online experience that was as innovative as they are. Partnering with the in-house Global Marketing Events team, we focused on creating an online hub for all things F8.

## Pivoting, Planning, and Presentations

From the beginning, we realized that it was necessary to create an online experience that would adapt to the dynamic and live nature of the event by continuously releasing updates throughout the week. We also understood the importance of creating a site that easily allowed all attendees to check in throughout the day to figure out which sessions or keynotes they’d find interesting both on-site and digitally.

## Mobile-First Community Hub

Over four months, we successfully crafted a fully branded mobile-first site built on React and Parse. This experience featured a live, real-time event schedule, daily product unveilings, and a system for enabling creators from around the world to organize meetups to enjoy F8 together. Additionally, we built solutions to handle conference event registration that allowed users to buy and manage registrations and hotel accommodations.

To convey the message of connectivity, I also partnered with design to quickly iterate and prototype various 3D concepts to elevate our overall design language.

## Finding Our (Your) Way

Finding Our (Your) Way
During development, we also realized the significance of having a well-designed signage and wayfinding system. Partnering with event staff, we set out to develop a centralized system capable of displaying up-to-date information for each break-out room and general schedule information throughout the weekend. This allowed our attendees to navigate the gigantic 500k sqft venue.

We also recognized that with a system this large, we’d need to have global override capabilities, allowing us to update info about happy hours and other social events. Additionally, we also built a Twilio-powered logging platform to send texts to our team if any hardware failures happened throughout the conference.
