## Setting the Stage

When 4,000 developers, entrepreneurs, and creators came together for Meta’s F8 Conference, the challenge was to deliver an online and on-site experience that matched the scale and ambition of the event. Partnering with Meta’s Global Marketing Events team, I worked to design and build the central hub for all things F8.

## Designing for Live Events

The site needed to adapt to the real-time nature of the conference, with continuous updates across the week. We focused on usability, ensuring attendees could browse sessions, track announcements, and check in daily whether they were in the convention center or tuning in online.

## Building the Platform

In just four months, we launched a fully branded, mobile-first site built with React and Parse. Core features included real-time schedules, daily product unveilings, and registration tools integrated with hotels. We also built global community features that enabled creators worldwide to host meetups and participate in F8 together. To elevate the experience, I collaborated with design on immersive 3D concepts that shaped the event’s digital identity.

## Navigating the Venue

Inside the 500,000 sq. ft. conference hall, I engineered a digital signage and wayfinding system that powered 300+ displays with real-time updates. Global override tools let us broadcast urgent announcements, while a Twilio-powered monitoring platform ensured hardware uptime by texting our team about failures in seconds.

## Delivering the Impact

The platform scaled seamlessly to support 50,000+ attendees on-site and millions more online. With product launches in AR and deep learning broadcast globally, the F8 digital experience set a new bar for large-scale event technology, merging physical and digital worlds into a single, connected conference.

Oh also my 3D models looked great on stage.
