## The Challenge

At Kin, I led the rebuild of KinHR, our SaaS platform for workplace operations and HR automation. The goal was to create a scalable foundation that enabled teams to ship new features quickly while modernizing the product for long-term growth.

## Our Direction

A full audit revealed critical gaps: no automated testing, limited documentation, and fragile frontend code that made changes risky. Accessibility and standards compliance were also lagging.

I drove the decision to rebuild the frontend architecture from the ground up, creating a foundation that could support a new design language and sustain rapid iteration.

## Finding Focus

We took a data-driven approach to prioritization, combining user feedback with analytics to identify which features mattered most. With scope defined, I partnered with product managers, design, and stakeholders to map out an 18-month plan that balanced customer needs with technical feasibility.

## Making It Real

To raise quality and velocity, I introduced Storybook, component-driven development, unit testing, linting, and consistent formatting across repos. These systems gave engineers confidence to ship without fear of regressions, improving both consistency and maintainability.

## Learning from Feedback

Throughout development, I worked with design and backend teams to ensure user needs drove technical decisions. For example, feedback on Employee Reviews led us to enable custom review questions, increasing flexibility.

On the backend, I aligned with engineers on API schemas and error handling, reducing rework and improving collaboration.

## What It Achieved

The rebuild delivered a faster, more usable product that improved developer velocity, enhanced customer experience, and positioned KinHR (4.5K users) for acquisition by Wagepoint.

Post-acquisition, I supported Wagepointâ€™s engineering and management teams through onboarding, infrastructure refinement, and documentation.
