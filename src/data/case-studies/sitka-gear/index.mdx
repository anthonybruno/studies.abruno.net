## Taking the Challenge

While running my own consultancy, I partnered with a small cross-functional team of designers and developers to deliver an ambitious project for Sitka Gear: building a full atomic design system in just six weeks.

## Planning the Build

With visuals already in place, we mapped out the essential components first. This allowed layouts to move forward while I focused on completing the full design library.

## Delivering the System

Working alongside Sitkaâ€™s design team, we shipped a reusable component library that powered their eCommerce platform with a consistent, scalable experience. Elements of the system remain in use today.
