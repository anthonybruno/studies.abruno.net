## Curiosity in Action

Signal started as a personal experiment to explore AI systems and modern frameworks hands-on. I wanted to understand how agentic workflows, retrieval systems, and multi-service architectures could actually function together — not just in theory, but in a real build.

## Turning a Portfolio into a Product

Instead of a static portfolio, I created a chatbot that could walk people through my work. This playful, creative choice turned curiosity into something concrete: a live demo that blended technical depth with accessibility, showing I could design and deliver AI-powered user experiences.

## Building the System

Signal runs as a multi-service platform: a Next.js frontend, Express backend, ChromaDB-powered RAG, and an MCP server for structured actions. Each piece is containerized and deployed with GitHub workflows — reflecting the practices I’d bring to building scalable, production-ready systems.

## The Outcome

What began as a sandbox for curiosity evolved into a proving ground for new practices. Signal gave me space to refine AI workflows like automated scaffolds and context-aware prompting, lessons I later carried into team environments to cut review cycles and raise quality. It also reinforced how creativity and systems thinking can produce solutions that scale well beyond a single project.
